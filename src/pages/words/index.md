## Word Progressions (L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí L3)

Vocabulary building through structured word progressions from basic to advanced levels.

## üéØ How This Works

Each word progression shows:
- **L1 (Basic)**: Everyday, common words everyone knows
- **L2 (Intermediate)**: More sophisticated, educated vocabulary  
- **L3 (Advanced)**: Refined, literary, or specialized terms

Perfect for expanding vocabulary naturally across all six languages: **EN ‚Ä¢ DE ‚Ä¢ IT ‚Ä¢ GR ‚Ä¢ BG ‚Ä¢ SR**

## üìö Available Progressions
